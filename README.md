# Social Media Analytics Evil

This repository contains an analysis of social media engagement for Evil. The project is divided into two parts, with the following questions addressed:

1. What is the typical engagement rate we can expect? Whatâ€™s the likelihood that we can achieve a 15% engagement rate?
2. Does day of the week and time of posting affect engagement rates?
3. How are our game titles doing in terms of social performance? Is there a specific game we should focus more on or less?
4. What media type performs the best?
5. What is our best performing campaign?
6. Define out a posting strategy for our social channels based on your discoveries.
7. What suggestions would you give to the social media team if they want to expand their presence (e.g. if our CSGO YouTube channel is doing well should we expand to TikTok)?
